# SpartanTutor


Spartan Tutor is a website built for the purpose of connecting students with counselors in San Jose State University. Sometimes in school it is hard to find
counselors that can help you with needs such as stress and depression, so we developed this site in order to have a connection 
between counselors and students that can occur any time of the day. 

This website was built using htmlm css, and javascript. We used a local server and Xamp for the database. The database was used to hold
the messages for each session that was created between the student and the counselor, and also to create profiles for each student or counselor.
